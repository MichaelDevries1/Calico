        //Board creation for 4 players
        // Game Board: Create a game board with a hexagonal grid representing a quilting pattern. Each hexagon can have
        // different colors and patterns.

        // Tiles: Develop a tile system to represent different quilt patterns. Players will be placing these tiles onto
        // their individual quilts during the game.

        // Player Boards: Implement player boards that represent individual quilts. These boards can have spaces for
        // players to place tiles and score points based on specific patterns or color combinations.

        // Tile Selection: Allow players to choose tiles from a central display or a common pool. The selection process
        // may involve a draft or other mechanics.

        // Scoring Mechanism: Develop a scoring system based on achieving specific goals, such as creating color
        // patterns, connecting certain tiles, or forming groups of similar patterns on the player's quilt.

        // Challenge Tiles: Integrate challenge tiles or cards that provide specific goals for players to achieve
        // during the game, adding a strategic element.

        // Cat Tokens: In "Calico," players can attract cats to their quilt by creating specific patterns. Implement a
        // mechanism where players can place cat tokens on their quilts for bonus points.

        // Endgame Conditions: Determine the conditions that trigger the end of the game, such as filling the entire
        // quilt, achieving a certain score, or completing a specific number of challenge tiles.

        // Component Interaction: Code the interaction between different game components, such as how tiles interact
        // with each other on the quilt and how scoring conditions are checked.

        // AI (if applicable): If you plan to have AI opponents, consider implementing AI logic for their tile
        // placement and strategy.

        // User Interface (UI): Design a user-friendly interface for players to interact with the game, including
        // dragging and dropping tiles, viewing their quilts, and accessing information about the game state.
